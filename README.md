# Heart Disease Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

A Python machine learning project that uses logistic regression to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical data. This project demonstrates end-to-end data loading, exploration, model building, and evaluation—ideal for beginners and educational purposes.

## Features

1. **Data Exploration**: Loads and analyzes the dataset with pandas and descriptive statistics.

2. **Visualization**: Uses matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization and exploration.

3. **Model Training**: Implements logistic regression to classify whether heart disease is present.

4. **Evaluation**: Includes accuracy score, R², and mean absolute error for model validation.

5. **Clean, Commented Code**: Written to be easily understood and modified.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/hashid31/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

This project uses Python 3 and a few popular libraries. Install them with pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
3. **Run the Notebook**

Start Jupyter Notebook and open main.ipynb (or open the notebook in VS Code).
